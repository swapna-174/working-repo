"I received this picture from our driver. Can you confirm whose car is the black one and who owns the white bike? Also, I noticed the bike is parked incorrectlyâ€”bikes should be parked in the designated bike space, not in the pathway. Additionally, there are cycles occupying bike spaces. Could we please have them moved out of the way?
