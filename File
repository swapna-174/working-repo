Mike,


I wanted to share the two stored procedures for the Care Coordination Extract that we use weekly. 


 While I haven't started working on the quarterly reports yet, I have  forwarded the emails  that contain all of them when you can. Additionally, we have the stored procedure approved by Epic; however, we are still trying to resolve issues with retrieving data for the "Note" attribute, which is currently blank for all encounters, as well as the note type for encounters. I have the SQL query suggested by Mark, but it’s still not functioning as expected.Mike,
