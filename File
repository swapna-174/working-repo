I am currently learning data science to improve my skills in analyzing and interpreting data. This includes studying Python programming, data manipulation with pandas and numpy, data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, and basic machine learning concepts. My goal is to use these skills to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decisions
