"I'm really having a hard time helping Kiran understand the details of this spreadsheet. I handed it over to you, and the return should have been from your account or Akka's—that's how it works here in the USA; otherwise, your account gets seized by the bank. I don't recognize any of these people involved, and I don't understand why Ramu was brought into these transactions or why it was transferred to Kiran's account. Did you even get his consent before transferring the amount to his account? I transferred it to Akka's account, and the next day, you transferred it back from a different account—I don't understand why you asked me to transfer it in the first place.
