Hi Jim,


Please can someone from the team execute the attached SQL and provide me with the results. I tasked to work on mapping the Cerner MRN to Epic MRN -Although I have access to Epic  Hyerspace ,clarity,caboodle -I don’t have to some of the stage lookup tables which needed for mapping .

This is one time request and I don’t it would make sense to go the snowflake team in requesting access
