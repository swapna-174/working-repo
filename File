"I found this message too difficult to respond to initially, which is why we did not reply. I thought it would be best to remain quiet and let things settle down before responding, as I did not want to add fuel to the fire."

And also, you're not my manager, so there's no need to respond that quickly. You're more than a friend to me, and I'll talk to you directly to resolve the issue instead of replying to this message. I know these are tough words, especially after she spoke to you. Please ask her to stay away from both of usâ€”we can handle things ourselves.
