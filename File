As per our prior discussion, I've allocated some time to delve deeper into crafting the ADF workflow centered around importing the Patient list for the CTMS project. This entails importing the .csv file into the staging table and executing a fuzzy matching algorithm against the current patient data in the CTMS tables. Additionally, please ensure inclusion of the MRN if the patient is present in Epic's Patient table.
