Subject: Care Coordination Extract Updates

Hi Mike,

I wanted to share the two stored procedures for the Care Coordination Extract that we use weekly.

While I haven't started working on the quarterly reports yet, I have forwarded the emails that contain all the necessary information for your reference.

Additionally, the stored procedure has been approved by Epic; however, we're still encountering issues with retrieving data for the "Note" attribute, which remains blank for all encounters, as well as for the note type associated with those encounters.

I also have the SQL query suggested by Mark, but it isn’t functioning as expected. Let me know if you’d like to review it together or discuss any potential solutions.
