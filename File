 I,m really having hard time with Kiran in helping him understand going though this detailed level of spreadheet . I gave it to you and return should have been from your account or Akka's (thats what it is done here in USA other wise your account is seizd  by the bank)  . I dont even recegonize any of these people here and why Ramu came into these T/R and why it was transferred to Kiran's account .I am not sure if you have taken his constent before someone transferrring amount to his account. I transfered it to Akka's account and next day you transferred it back from a differeent acoount -I dont understand why have asked me to transfer "
