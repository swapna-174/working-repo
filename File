I strive to bridge the gap between complex clinical data and meaningful insights by building efficient SQL extracts, optimizing data workflows, and ensuring data integrity across platforms like Caboodle, Clarity, and Snowflake. Through collaboration, continuous learning, and problem-solving, I aim to support better patient care and drive data-informed improvements across the organization."
